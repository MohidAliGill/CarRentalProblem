# CarRentalProblem

This repository contains the coursework submission for the COMP4041-LDO Linear and Discrete Optimization module for the Autumn Semester, Session 2023-2024.

Project Overview

The coursework involves solving the Car Rental optimization problems described in sections 12.25 and 12.26 of the book Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H.P. Williams (5th edition, 2013). The optimization models for these problems are detailed in sections 13.25 and 13.26, with the optimal solutions described in sections 14.25 and 14.26. The task is to develop both a spreadsheet model and an LP-Solve model for these problems, and to create a demonstration video explaining the models.
